        <h3>Robo Mania STEM Learning Center Counselor</h3>
        <p>
          Over the summer after my freshman year, I tutored at a local robotics
          camp to get back in touch with my engineering roots and help a new
          generation of designers and thinkers.

          was deeply nostalgic and akin to the various workshops I participated
          in for robotics and coding at a young age. Teaching kids essential
          concepts and promoting the method of thinking posed a wonderful
          experience and challenge! The joy and the “Aha!” moment on their faces
          when they solved that immovable problem brought deep content and
          reason for me to be patient and guiding with the students. This
          experience helped the students become better thinkers and exposed them
          to a world of possibilities, the very same world that led me here!

        <h3>Leander ISD Superintendent Student Council Member</h3>
        <p>
          This opportunity came to me unexpectedly, as it is one where you are
          selected based on the nominations of others. Thus, I had the unique
          and humble chance to present ideas directly to the superintendent of
          Leander ISD along with some other students in the district. Realizing
          the gravitas of this position, I spent much time deliberating over
          what problems to shine light on. In the end, I realized that the
          integration of soft skill development was severely lacking in most
          classroom curricula, and made efforts to promote its importance to the
          council. We made a year long onboarding plan to incorporate lessons on
          soft skills and building comfort for in class presentations. We made
          it certain that the integration is gradual and relevant to the class
          curriculums, as the intention is for students to understand the
          omnipresence of communication without getting overwhelmed or anxious.

        <h3>CSCE 312 Teaching Assistant - Upcoming</h3>
        <p>
          Being a student, I understand the importance of good teaching
          assistants and the knowledge they can share. I would like to give back
          to Texas A&M by helping students. A teaching assistant for computer
          organization is a phenomenal approach to achieving this, as it
          requires the TAs to teach vital concepts and help students in the lab.
          Further, this topic is one that I seek to master, so being in the
          position to teach it serves as an invaluable experience for me as
          well. Another interesting note about CSCE 312 is that most students in
          it either have a misconception or negative opinion about computer
          architecture and its role in computer science. I hope to bring new
          perspectives to these students and help them appreciate the beauty of
          hardware design, and its importance in software development!
