          <h3>Verilog & SystemC</h3>
          <p>
            Verilog is an essential skill to know for hardware design. It is one
            of the most used hardware description languages in industry, and a
            key tool for front end behavioral development. I would classify
            myself as an “advanced beginner” in this HDL because I have 3
            classes worth of experience using this tool. In ECEN 468, I learnt
            some advanced capabilities and its limitations in regards to
            simulation vs. synthesis. SystemC is a newer higher level language
            designed for quick development and high level synthesis of focused
            systems (such as ASICs). I was exposed to SystemC in ECEN 468 and
            have modeled the Canny Edge Detector ASIC detailed in my Projects
            section in this language as well as Verilog.

          <h3>ARMv8 & C++</h3>
          <p>
            My computer science courses all used C++ for development (barring
            this course), so I have intermediate experience with the tool. My
            computer systems class made me especially comfortable with more
            complex topics such as threading, networking, and cryptography in
            this low level OOP language, and inherently making me more
            comfortable with memory management. I learnt a subset of ARMv8 in my
            computer architecture class, and am able to trace and program
            recursive programs amongst many others. Though this is not an
            essential skill in industry, it has helped me immensely in
            understanding the bridge between hardware and programmer.

        <h3>Areas of Interest</h3>
        <p>
          As aforementioned, my interests mostly revolve around computer
          architecture and design. ECEN 248 provided my first ever exposure to
          behavioral implementations of gate level designs, and presented a
          fascinating peek into the world of truly parallel modeling. ECEN 350
          and my completion of NAND to Tetris explored my fascination with
          datapath modeling and advanced mechanisms that make current processors
          adept. In the process of exploring design, my professors and mentors
          made clear the importance of verification. And after earning my
          upcoming internship in Design Verification, this is also an area that
          I look forward to learning. Though I do not have much experience now,
          I will be involving myself in various courses, research, and
          experiences to fully explore this essential sector. I also intend to
          use
          <a href="https://verificationacademy.com/" target="_blank"
            >Verification Academy</a
          >
          which is free to access via my TAMU email! Further, after taking my
          computer organization course, CSCE 313, I realized the importance and
          complexity of low level systems design, and its elegant interface with
          hardware.
