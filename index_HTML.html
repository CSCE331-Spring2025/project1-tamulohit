        <h3>Howdy!</h3>
        <p>
          I’m Lohitaksh (Lohit) Allampalli, a junior in computer engineering
          major at Texas A&M! This is my professional website for CSCE 331. My
          interests pertain to technology, and have evolved from understanding
          robotics to appreciating hardware design and architecture. Mentorship
          and coursework enlightened my view of the semiconductor industry, and
          encouraged me to take courses such as advanced computer architecture,
          embedded systems, and digital design. I love understanding context in
          this field and take efforts to build a holistic yet detailed view of
          its various topics. As such, I am pursuing my Masters in Computer
          Engineering to better fulfill this goal! Feel free to connect with me
          on

      <h3>Here's what I am doing currently!</h3>
      <p>
        Currently, I am a full time student taking Introduction to SWE, Advanced
        Computer Architecture, Digital VLSI, and Microprocessor Architecture. As
        I work towards my Masters, I take the graduate versions for VLSI and
        Microprocessors. Further, I participate in Dr. Tyagi’s Verification Lab
        in preparation for my undergraduate thesis in senior year! His lab
        recently received much funding from NSF which prompted the acceleration
        of the
        <a href="https://wavechip.tamu.edu/" target="_blank">WaveChip Program</a
        >.
      </p>

      <h3>Here's what I've done recently!</h3>
      <p>
        I participated in Robomaster Robotics as a Embedded Software Systems
        member for one year, where I improved the latency of the aiming system
        for the Standard robot by implementing a software latch between the
        microcontroller and referee communication module. Last semester, I
        contributed to the Tactile VR research group where I helped set up their
        new embedded systems, where I learned of the
        <a href="http://www.orangepi.org/" target="_blank">Orange Pi</a>, and
        documented processes on how to switch from their existing Arduino to
        these new platforms.

      <h3>Fun facts!</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I was President of FIRST Robotics in high school, and the picture
          below is the robot we worked on with 6 motors and two modes for torque
          - this was a beast of a machine!
        </li>
        <li>
          Below is also my artwork from 10th grade that I am overly proud of.
          Doodling can be addicting.
        </li>
        <li>
          I love open world games such as Minecraft and Terraria, as well as
          card games like Uno!
        </li>
        <li>
          I will be at
          <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/" target="_blank">NVIDIA</a>
          this summer as an ASIC Design Verification Intern!
